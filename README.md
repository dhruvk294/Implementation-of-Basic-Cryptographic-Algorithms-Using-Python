# Cryptography with Python

This project demonstrates the practical implementation of core cryptographic techniques using Python and the PyCryptodome library. It includes examples of:

-  Symmetric Encryption with AES-GCM  
-  Asymmetric Encryption and Digital Signatures using RSA  
-  Hashing and HMAC with SHA-256  

##  Features

- AES-256 GCM encryption and decryption (with authentication tag)
- RSA (2048-bit) public-private key generation
- Secure encryption using RSA-OAEP
- Digital signature creation and verification using RSA-PSS
- Message hashing with SHA-256
- HMAC implementation for integrity and authenticity

##  Project Structure

- `crypto_demo.py` â€” Main script containing all cryptographic implementations
- Functions are modular and easy to test or integrate into other projects

##  Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- PyCryptodome  
  Install via pip: pip install pycryptodome
